# Weather App
I was tasked with creating a weather app where users can search by city name and view
the weather status for that city. The data for the weather is being pulled from the open weather api
and all searched city entries that can be found from that api upon search are stored locally to be pulled
from whenever the user revisits the app. If the user clicks a previous search it will display the weather
data for that city as well. This was made using html, css, javascript, jquery and bootstrap.
